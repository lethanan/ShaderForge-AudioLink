This fork simply adds an AudioLink node, so that AudioLink compatible shaders can be made in Shader Forge. 

The AudioLink node takes the X and Y coordinates of the AudioLink texture and outputs a float. There are a handful of presets built-in. Otherwise, you can put in custom coordinates, which can be found in this unofficial reference for the AudioLink texture: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PkA98uI_zslpTr6ARBVGOBSq5Yna0rKPe_RWbdtbERM/

You can preview the AudioLink effects if you put the AudioLinkAvatar prefab in your scene, add a sound file to the input, and press play. The effects should appear in the Shader Forge preview in real-time.

Please note that the implementation is currently very simple and largely untested.

ORIGINAL SHADER FORGE README:

hey everyone~

I will occasionally update this repository with fixes and features!
I'll mostly do compatibility updates for future versions of Unity whenever I need it. if you want older versions, consider pulling one of the older branches! I'll try to name branches helpfully. the oldest version of SF you can get is for Unity 5.x

also, please don't pressure me into doing or fixing things because holy heck I was burnt out at the end of Shader Forge's first lifetime üëÄ I'm mostly working on this casually, either when I need a fix or a new feature, or when I have time to fix something other people really want to see fixed!

also, if you enjoy or are currently enjoying or finding Shader Forge useful, please consider supporting me, if you're able to!

you can either do a one-time donation on PayPal at https://www.paypal.me/acegikmo ‚ú®

or a monthly donation on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/acegikmo üíñ

support is entirely optional though, I intend to keep this project open and free, but if you do donate, thank you so hecking much!! if you want to reach me, Twitter is the best place https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer üê¶
